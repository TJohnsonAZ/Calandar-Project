# D.4 Implementation 1  

### Introduction  
- The "Project Calandar" Project aims to give the user a way to track their daily activities and whether or not they are complete. The system enables users to create a calendar for an activity, and populates a calendar for it. The calendar shows a monthly view, and when a day is clicked the user has the option of selecting if they have completed, not completed, or if they want to clear it for that day. Their responses are stored on a remote server and loaded into the application at start up.
- Value Proposition:
    - "Project Calandar" Project is a free calendar app that helps users track habits and routines on a daily basis. Individuals can track their workout routines, eating habits, smoking habits, and other habits in a visual way which provides the individual with instant feedback. This gives the user gratification and motivation to continue keeping up with their habits. Our product is unique in that the user of the app can extensively customize the colors of the app's user interface and receive reminders about their habits.

### Implemented Requirements 
- Use cases:
    - Create calendar for activity - Calvin, Zach
    - Mark a day in the calendar as completed or incomplete - Logan
    - View tracking summary - Trevor

- MVP Requirements:
    - A view of one full calendar - Calvin, Zach, Logan
    - An activity with an associated color - Adam
    - Syncing calendar with the server - Adam, Kadan
    - Accessable summary view - Trevor

### Adopted Technologies  
##### Android Studio (Front End)  
- What is it?  
    - Official IDE for Android Development  
    - Based on IntelliJ IDEA  
    - Gradle-based build system  
- Why did we choose it?  
    - Android platform is easier to work with than Apple/Xcode  
    - Built in compiler (Xcode requires a build stage)  
    - Primarily Java based  
        - Comfortable language choice for the group  
    - XML very similar to HTML  
	
#### Spring Boot (Back End)
- What is it?
    - Open source framework
    - Built on top of the Spring Framework
    - Includes dependencies to shorten code length and simplifying Spring set up
    - Allows development of enterprise-class applications
    - Utilizes the Tomcat servlet container
- Why did we choose it?
    - Website packages all dependencies into a zip file making set up very easy
    - Industry professional recommended it for our application
    - Extensive documentation and reference material available online
#### Gradle
- What is it?
    - An automated build tool
    - Runs automated tests
- Why did we choose it?
    - Built into Android Studio
    - Automatic with Android Studio
#### Maven
- What is it?
    - Maven is an automated build ssytem
    - Simple way to build and test executables
- Why did we choose it?
    - To learn multiple technologies (in addition to Gradle  
    - Simple to use for our requirements
    - Easy to deploy executable
    - Integration with Spring)

### Learning/Training
#### To Learn:  
Each side of this project (front-end/back-end) had one major developmental tool to learn. The front-end had to learn the tricks of Android Studio, while the back-end had to learn Spring. To learn Android Studio and XML to create the feeling and user-interface of the app, we looked up a bunch of examples for parts that we wished to implement. For example, to lay the buttons out in the way that we wanted, we looked for examples online for how to create buttons.
For the back-end, we were fortunate in our learning experience. We had the ability to contact a software engineer who used Spring on a daily basis, and they were generous enough to give an overview on the tool. Since that overview, we have continued to revieve assistance from them. Outside of their help, we have used Spring's own resources to further our learning. 
  
#### To Train:  
We split our group into two groups of three, which each group focusing on one half of the project. To bring the other half up to speed, we did a q&a during one of our weekly meetings. During this time, we each presented the code we wrote, describing how things work and why. Then everyone else asked questions, which were answered by the presenter and other members of the group. This helped concrete the knowledge for the presenter, and built an understanding for the rest of the group. 

### Deployment
- Android application download is available at
    - https://github.com/TJohnsonAZ/Calandar-Project/raw/main/Deployment/CalandarApp_D4_Release.apk    
- APK file retrived on download, must be moved to an android device if not downloaded on one
    - Click APK to install on android device
    - If no android device, APK can be loaded into Android Studio or emulator for use

### Licensing

**GNU License:**  
   - [Our License](https://github.com/TJohnsonAZ/Calandar-Project/blob/zak52_branch/LICENCES)  
   
   - [GNU License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)  

We chose a GNU license so people can do a lot of things to our project for the most part, we just do not want people distributing the project.  
We want to make sure people can still do stuff with out project without profitting from it
   
### Readme File
- Create readme file with a bunch of stuff

### Look & Feel
- Approach used to design user interface

### Lessons Learned
- What did we learn during the first release
  - How to implement a java-based sever
  - How to work with a user-interface
  - How to communicate between a server and a web application
  - Packaging and distribution of a server
  
- What can we improve on for the second release
  - Better communication between groups
  - Better understanding of requirements
  - More time spent discussing a solution
