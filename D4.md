### Adopted Technologies

        - Gradle-based build system  
    - Why did we choose it?  
        - Android platform is easier to work with than Apple/Xcode  
        - Built in compiler (Xcode requires a build stage)  
        - Primarily Java based  
            - Comfortable language choice for the group  
	- XML very similar to HTML  
	
#### Spring Boot (Back End)
    - What is it?
        - Open source framework
        - Built on top of the Spring Framework
        - Includes dependencies to shorten code length and simplifying Spring set up
        - Allows development of enterprise-class applications
        - Utilizes the Tomcat servlet container
    - Why did we choose it?
        - Website packages all dependencies into a zip file making set up very easy
        - Industry professional recommended it for our application
        - Extensive documentation and reference material available online
#### Gradle
    - What is it?
    - Why did we choose it?
        - Built in to Android Studio
#### Maven

### Learning/Training
- Android Studio
    - Strategies employed to learn
- Spring Framework
    - Strategies employed to learn

### Deployment
- Android application download is available at
    - Some dropbox link (updated when software ready)
- APK file retrived on download, must be moved to an android device if not downloaded on one
    - Click APK to install on android device
    - If no android device, APK can be loaded into Android Studio or emulator for use

### Licensing
- Look into this
    - Links on D4 page probably explain more

### Readme File
- Create readme file with a bunch of stuff

### Look & Feel
- Approach used to design user interface

### Lessons Learned
