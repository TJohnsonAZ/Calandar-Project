D.4 Implementation 1

### Introduction
- Describe system
    - Should include value proposition and main features
    - At the end include GitHub and Trello links

### Implementation Requirements
- List of requirements (user stories, issues, or use cases) implemented in this release
    - Must have features specified in MVP from D2
- Break down coding assignments by group members
- Use issue tracker to manage implementation tasks (they will check)

### Adopted Technologies
##### Android Studio (Front End)
    - What is it?
        - Official IDE for Android Development
        - Based on IntelliJ IDEA
        - Gradle-based build system
    - Why did we choose it?
        - Android platform is easier to work with than Apple/Xcode
        - Built in compiler (Xcode requires a build stage)
	- Simple tools for user interface (drag-and-drop/xml)
        - Primarily Java based
            - Comfortable language choice for the group
#### Spring Boot (Back End)
    - What is it?
        - Open source framework
        - Built on top of the Spring Framework
        - Includes dependencies to shorten code length and simplifying Spring set up
        - Allows development of enterprise-class applications
        - Utilizes the Tomcat servlet container
    - Why did we choose it?
        - Website packages all dependencies into a zip file making set up very easy
        - Industry professional recommended it for our application
        - Extensive documentation and reference material available online
	- Ease of use (annotations)

### Learning/Training
The first week we have split up our development into two groups, a front-end group and a back-end group. During this week, as we work on the prototype, we will be gaining experience on our respective tools (Spring/Android Studio). After the week, each member will conduct an informal presentation, highlighting important features, limitations of the tool, tricks and tools to ease the use of the app. Through these presentation, we will be better equipped to develop on either end of the system.

### Deployment
- How is the program being deployed?
- Link for system in production

### Licensing
- Look into this
    - Links on D4 page probably explain more

### Readme File
- Create readme file with a bunch of stuff

### Look & Feel
- Approach used to design user interface

### Lessons Learned
- What did we learn during the first release
- What can we improve on for the second release

### Demo
