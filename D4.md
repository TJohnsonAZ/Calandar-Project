### Adopted Technologies  
##### Android Studio (Front End)  
    - What is it?  
        - Official IDE for Android Development

        - Gradle-based build system  
    - Why did we choose it?  
        - Android platform is easier to work with than Apple/Xcode  
        - Built in compiler (Xcode requires a build stage)  
        - Primarily Java based  
            - Comfortable language choice for the group  
	- XML very similar to HTML  
	
#### Spring Boot (Back End)
    - What is it?
        - Open source framework
        - Built on top of the Spring Framework
        - Includes dependencies to shorten code length and simplifying Spring set up
        - Allows development of enterprise-class applications
        - Utilizes the Tomcat servlet container
    - Why did we choose it?
        - Website packages all dependencies into a zip file making set up very easy
        - Industry professional recommended it for our application
        - Extensive documentation and reference material available online
#### Gradle
    - What is it?
    - Why did we choose it?
        - Built in to Android Studio
