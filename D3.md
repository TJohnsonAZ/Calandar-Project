# Deliverable 3 - Analysis


### System Description
    Project Calandar Project is a free calendar app that helps users track habits and routines on a daily basis. Individuals can track their workout routines, eating habits, smoking habits, and other habits in a visual way which provides the individual with instant feedback. This gives the user gratification and motivation to continue keeping up with their habits. Our product is unique in that the user of the calandar app can extensively customize the colors of the app’s user interface and receive reminders about user habits. Project Calandar Project solves the problem of people committing to goals which affects goal oriented people. This results in people giving up on those goals. For goal oriented people who struggle to keep track of progress, App Calandar App is a calendar app that helps keep track of goals and habits using color coordination unlike Streaks, which does not display progress using colors or a calendar.

    Our system involves a user of our app and a web server. The webserver stores user information so that if the user were to download the app on another device all of their data would be synced from the server to the users app. The user is able to create any number of calendars, each having any number of activities/habits associated with them. Upon creating a calendar the user can designate what color is associated with completion of an activity or a lack of  completion of an acitivity. The user can select any day in the calendar and associate a rgb or preset color with that activity to signify whether an acitivity/habit was completed or not. The user can view the calendar as a whole and see what days have been marked a certain color and gain instant feedback on their progress of completing their goals. To keep the user focused on their goals, the system will send the user a notification, reminding them to mark the activities/habits that they have completed in the day. There will also be a counter that the user will be able to set a period of time between events, and each time the avtivity is completed, a counter ticks up, rewarding the user every time they complete an activity.  On the day, the user will be able to leave a note, keeping even more detailed notes about their progress. These calendars will be able to be navigated much like Google Calendar, where the calendar can be viewed from a weekly or monthly view. The data can also be accessed through a summary view, where progress is listed in a more compact form.
