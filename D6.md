### Demo
- Video of working system
- Basically cover everything

### Code Quality
Back-End:  
	- Javadocs on all of our methods to facilitate understanding  
	- One true brace method for all code  
	- No one letter variables (excluding i for indexing)  
	- Meaningful method/variable/class names  
	- Each object had one purpose and we ensured that each part did its part well  
	- Looked for ways to reduce coupling within code  
	- Frequent meetings to discuss implementation  
	- Constant questioning to ensure high quality outcomes  

### Lessons Learned
- Describe what the team learned during the second release and what would change if development continued
- Problems encountered AND solutions to them
- Future implementations, possible issues and possible ideas to overcome
Back-end:  
	- If development continued we would update our databases, as Spring has its own implementation, and SQL is an option, but due to our inexperience, we developed a simple csv database.
	- We would change the users to be more secure, possibly with a password
	- A bigger struggle than expected was the jump to multi-user support. Our code for first release did not work as expected, and so our multi-user code did not work when implemented. So we debugged the previous methods. Our solution involved the user objects working with the data for each of the days.
	- Another issue was determining what would be included in the summary class. To figure this out, we looked at the summary type objects in other systems, and built our based off of that. So we included the days in a row an activity was completed, as well as the amount of activities, etc.
	- Some issues involve the inefficiency of our database. Currently, it is simply a large csv with all of the data stored in it, which is O(n) complexity, and is thus very slow as the number of users increases. This is something that would be fixed in future implementations.
