# D5 Design

### Description
- 1 to 2 paragraphs to describe system
    - can reuse and update text from previous deliverables

### Architecture
- Diagram of high-level architecture
    - Use UML package diagram to describe main modules and how they interrelate

### Class diagram
- Refine class diagram, include implementation details
    - visibilities
    - attributes
    - attribute types
    - return types
    - parameters
- Should match code

### Sequence diagram
- Diagram that represents how objects in the system interact for a specific use case
- Include use case description here
- Be consistent with class diagram and architecture

### Design patterns
- 2 sections
    - UML class diagrams showing the application of a design pattern to system
        - a different pattern for each section
        - each diagram only contain classes involved in the specific pattern
            - don't need to represent full systen
        - patterns from Behavioral, Structural, or Creational (or outside of those mentioned in class)
- GitHub links to corresponding classes

### Design principles
- How does design observe SOLID principles
- description of followed principles giving concrete examples from classes
