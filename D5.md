# D5 Design

### Description
- 1 to 2 paragraphs to describe system
    - can reuse and update text from previous deliverables

### Architecture
![UMLPackageDiagram](Images/UMLPackageDiagram.png)
- The two main parts of our project are the android app (front end) and the server it communicates with (back end). Each of these have their own package containing many other packages representing the classes and APIs used by them. The arrows between packages indicate that one uses or has access to another. This also applies with larger scale interactions, meaning the user uses the front end and the front end has access to the back end. The front end contains UI related classes and the back end contains classes that store data to be accessed by the app, as well as SpringBoot, the API used to run the server.

### Class diagram
- Refine class diagram, include implementation details
    - visibilities
    - attributes
    - attribute types
    - return types
    - parameters
- Should match code

### Sequence diagram
- Diagram that represents how objects in the system interact for a specific use case
- Include use case description here
- Be consistent with class diagram and architecture

### Design patterns
![ClassDiagram](Images/ClassDiagram.jpg)
- GitHub links to corresponding classes

### Design principles
- How does design observe SOLID principles
- description of followed principles giving concrete examples from classes
