# D7 Verification and Validation  

## 1. Description  
Project Calandar Project is a free calendar app that helps users track habits and routines on a daily basis. Individuals can track their workout routines, eating habits, smoking habits, and other habits in a visual way which provides the individual with instant feedback. This gives the user gratification and motivation to continue keeping up with their habits. Our product is unique in that the user of the calandar app can extensively customize the colors of the app’s user interface and receive reminders about user habits. While we've held as true to this as we can, features are a work in progress and are planned for future implementations.

## 3. Validation  

### Script: ###   
**Task 1:** Log in to user 1 and create your first activity. Mark any number of days as complete or incomplete and then try clearing some of the days of their markings.  
  1. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to create your first activity?  
  2. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to mark days as complete or incomplete? How easy was it to clear the current marking of a day marked as complete or incomplete?  

**Task 2:** While still logged in to user 1, create a new activity, name it whatever you like and choose a color for completion and incompletion. Mark a few days as complete or incomplete for activity 2 and then switch back to activity 1 and mark some days corresponding to activity 1.  
  1. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to add a new activity?  
  2. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to clear marked days or mark days as complete or incomplete for activities 1 and 2?  
  3. Do you like how the app switches between user activities? What could be improved?  

**Task 3:** Return to the user selection screen and select user 2.  
  1. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to return to the user selection screen?  

**Task 4:** While you are still logged into user 2, navigate to the month of July and mark the 3rd of July as complete for activity 1. Now create a new activity with the colors of your choosing and navigate to the month of May. Mark May 25th as incomplete for activity 2.  
  1. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to navigate through the calendar and mark days for activity 1 and activity 2?  
 

**Follow Up Questions:**

  3. Do you like how the app switches between user activities? What could be improved?

**Follow Up Questions:**
  1. Would you use the app in its current state? 
     * ````User 1 Response - "Yes. I do think the purpose and goal of the app is fulfilled"````  
     * ````User 2 Response - "Yes, probably, if it was smoothed out a touch more but other then that I like it." ````  
     * ````User 3 Response - "I would definitely use this app in its current state. In my opinion, this app looks crisp, clean, and professional. I thought the app itself was extremely user friendly. Having the choice between four different colors and tracking four different activities makes it straightforward to actually read the calendar."````     
  2. What was most unclear about using the app?
     * ````User 1 Response - "I think the most unclear parts of the app include getting started, how to create and edit activities, and which activity you are working on."````  
     * ````User 2 Response - "How to create a new activity."````  
     * ````User 3 Response - " Selecting a different activity on a certain day while under a different user. On some of the days, I can only mark the day with ‘Activity 1’ and state if it was complete or incomplete. Albeit, that may be because of user error, I’m not sure to be honest."````       
  3. Overall what could we improve about the app?  
     * ````User 1 Response - "Creating and editing activities: As mentioned previously, I would suggest making this function easier. I was not asked to for the purpose of this survey, but I did have a bit of trouble editing an activity. I picked no colors for my complete/incomplete colors, which led to not being able to mark as complete or incomplete effectively. Instead, to complete the task, I added a third activity. I think the activity portions overall could be a little bit easier to understand without any instruction."````  
     * ````User 2 Response - "Not much to be honest, it is very straightforward in my opinion, and I like the options of the different activities. It would be nice to be able to switch activities on the calendar so that when you want to look at certain activities it would show you without having to mark the day as complete or not."````  
     * ````User 3 Response - "Overall, I think the only thing that needs to be improved in the app is just being able to color coordinate days with the other users to display all activities on one calendar. This calendar is functional for its intended purpose, which is being able to track progress with daily activities."````  

  
#### Reflections: ####  

##### What Works Well #####
Based on the results, it is appropriate to say that the process required for the user to make their first calendar is easy, simple, and effective. On a scale of 1-10 where 10 is the easiest, all three users commented that creating their first calendar was at least a difficulty of 9 out of 10. This means out UI is effective for leading the user through the appropriate steps to name their first calendar. Our UI design was also successful in making it simple for users to mark days as complete, incomplete, or clear. One user rated this process as an 8 out of 10 while the other two users rated this process a 10 out of 10. Task two involved users creating a second activity and marking days as complete or incomplete. This task was not successful for user 3, but users 1 and 2 were able to figure out how to add a new activity after searching around the app UI. Users 1 and 2 both said it took them a while to figure out how to add a new activity but when they found it the process was immiediately made easier for them. User 1 and 2 rated this task a 7 and 9 respectively. Subsequently Users 1 and 2 reported that marking days as complete or incomplete for activity 2 was extremely easy once they figured out how to add an activity, rating this process a 10 out 10. All three users successfully switched from user 1 to user 2 and rated this process unanimously a 10 out of 10. User navigation between months was also rated as a 10 out of 10 by all three users. These results are promising and are only furthered by the user's follow up responses. All three users said they would use the app in its current state but would prefer it was "smoothed out a bit more". 

##### What Could Be Improved #####
It is obvious based on user feedback that we need to make it more clear how the user supposed to create a new activity. Currently there is an vertical ellipse button with no label which is used to add new activities and this made it confusing for new users to create a new activity. User two reported that they wished they could switch between activties without having to mark a day as complete or incomplete and user 1 reported that they would like to edit their activities after creating them. User 1 accidentilly created an activity without selecting any colors, and so they were left with a useless activity which would have required an app restart to remedy. Overall we could improve our app immensely by adding dedicated buttons to switch between user activites, adding an option to edit user activities, and improving the labeling of the creat new activity button.
