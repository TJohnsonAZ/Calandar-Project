  1. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to create your first activity?  
  2. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to mark days as complete or incomplete? How easy was it to clear the current marking of a day marked as complete or incomplete?  

**Task 2:** While still logged in to user 1, create a new activity, name it whatever you like and choose a color for completion and incompletion. Mark a few days as complete or incomplete for activity 2 and then switch back to activity 1 and mark some days corresponding to activity 1.  
  1. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to add a new activity?  
  2. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the hardest and 10 being the easiest, how simple was it to clear marked days or mark days as complete or incomplete for activities 1 and 2?
